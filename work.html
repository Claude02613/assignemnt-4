                <p>Having a long-distant relationship is hard, though it gives me inspiration for this artwork. As a sad love story that is narrative, I matter about both visual and sonic components. Using basic editing skills to make a series of flashbacks, which demonstrates the relationship between those three people. In addition, using jump cut or frame hold to pick up or slow down the pacing of the story. Combined with the visual part, it is the sonic component that generates the vibe that helps audiences immerse themselves into the story and understand the plot better.

                    Additionally, I used voice-over as a kind of conceptual part since there are just single words or chunks that pop out during the video. It is a nice try since the words are helpful for audiences to understand the relationship among the characters in a way. 
                    
                    Though I made it become a sad story, it matches the rain scene and phone call scene in the video. And on top of that, these elements all work for the emotion of the main character----the white boy. Using the flashbacks and montage of memories guides you go through the journey of his emotion.

                    <p>Regarding the topic "empty", I created a set of graphic icons that unify the elements relevant to the topic. By going through the drafts, sketches prototypes, and final projects. After screening out the sketches, some interesting thoughts reflect from the prototypes---- not only empty from the physical aspect but also the mental aspect or regional aspect. Therefore,  there are icons of death, mediation, and also greediness. Regarding the concept from religions, death means your anima is gone, and there is only a hollow shell left in the world. I reckon that death is one way that can demonstrate the "empty" theme to many people. Having everything is means having nothing, greediness always impacts people's decisions and this is what called the dark side of humanity. Once people cannot stop pursuing wealth, admiration, and power, they are just the walking dead. Additionally, Buddhism has concepts of egolessness as well. This artwork is aiming to let people thinking the meaning of empty critically, and on top of that, focus on themselves and the thing or people surrounding them.

                <p>For this artwork, I build a virtual environment to present a change in my student life. The first scene which has lots of hands and books is a conceptual space design, which uses this unreal scene design to demonstrate my mindset of me in the final semester of senior high. The pressure from examinations provokes students hard to breathe. The next scene shows how music changed the mindset and was a pressure outlet. Following the music, you will move to the second scene which has a retro-style sky and sunset, the car parking at the feet of the hill, and a bench placed on the top of the hill... you can picture that a commuter cannot stand for the pressure of fast-paced city life and job, driving far away from the city to the suburb. Enjoying the sunset peacefully. This artwork uses contrast and comparison between different scenes to demonstrate the dark time during the Chinese students' senior high. Additionally, aiming to let people know the mindset changing because of the music.
